I need to create an advertisement page for a company that provides the following services: 
•	AC technician
•	Epoxy coating
•	Water proofing
•	Wall painting
•	Tile fixing
•	Electrics
•	Plumbing
•	Overall maintenance

•	The company needs a high-level advertisement webpage, with a simple ‘contact us’ button. The contact us button should be effective and enable the user viewing the advertisement to contact the company for any enquiries. 

•	I have a few photos of the companies work aswell, I need you to help me with the placement of the photos on the advertisement page. 

STEP-BY-STEP PLAN:

Create project folder structure - Set up files (index.html, styles.css, script.js, assets/images/)
Generate complete HTML structure - Full page with hero, services, gallery, contact sections
Generate modern CSS styling - Mobile-first responsive design with animations
Generate JavaScript functionality - Lightbox, smooth scroll, form validation
Organize and rename images - Rename your 10 images to img-01.jpg through img-10.jpg
Add placeholder contact details - Use "Company Name", "000-000-0000", "email@example.com" placeholders
Test page locally - Open in browser and verify everything works
Create GitHub repo and deploy - Push to GitHub, deploy free on Cloudflare Pages
